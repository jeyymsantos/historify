            The <b>Renaissance</b> is a period in European history that spans around 1300 to 1600 and follows the Medieval period. The word "renaissance" comes from the French word "renaissance," which means "rebirth." 
            <br><br>
            The <b>Scientific Revolution </b> was the emergence of modern science in Europe between roughly 1550 and 1700, when breakthroughs in mathematics, physics, astronomy, biology (particularly human anatomy), and chemistry altered social conceptions about nature. The Scientific Revolution began in Europe at the end of the Renaissance and lasted until the late 18th century, influencing the Enlightenment intellectual social movement.
            <br><br>
            The period of the <b> Age of Enlightenment </b> in the Modern Era of Philosophy largely correlates to the 18th Century (1700). In general, the Enlightenment was an intellectual movement that supported freedom, democracy, and reason as the core principles of society, primarily in France, Britain, and Germany.
            <br><br>
            <b>Galileo Galilei</b> was the first to use a refracting telescope to make important astronomical discoveries, and he pioneered the scientific method of experimentation. Among other names, he is renowned as the "Father of Modern Astronomy" and the "Father of Modern Physics." Albert Einstein labeled Galileo the "Father of Modern Science."
            <br><br>
            The <b>Heliocentric Theory</b> was developed by <b>Nicolaus Copernicus</b>. The Greek term "helios" means "sun," and heliocentric refers to the position of the sun at the center of the universe. The planets in a heliocentric system rotate around a stationary sun. As a result, the sun is orbited by Mercury, Venus, the Earth, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. In this system, the moon is the sole celestial sphere that revolves around the earth and, with it, around the sun.
            <br><br>
            All planets move in elliptical orbits around the Sun, with the Sun as one of the foci, according to <b>Johanness Kepler's Three Laws of Planetary Motion</b>. A radius vector connecting each planet to the Sun sweeps out the same amount of area in the same amount of time. The squares of the sidereal periods of revolution of the planets are directly proportional to the cubes of their mean distances from the Sun.
            <br><br>
            The <b>Laws of Motion</b> were formulated by <b>Sir Isaac Newton</b>. Every item in uniform motion tends to stay in that state unless an external force is applied to the Law of Inertia. F = ma denotes the relationship between an object's mass m, acceleration a, and applied force F. Both acceleration and force are vectors, and the force vector in this rule has the same direction as the acceleration vector. There is an equal and opposite reaction to every action.

        In the 1700s, there was a period known as the <b>Industrial Revolution</b>. The <b> creation of steam engines </b> was vital to the industrialization of modern civilization, starting with Thomas Newcomen's introduction of the first functional Steam Engine at Dudley Castle coal mine in 1712. It was the most reliable source of energy for industry and transportation in the West for about 200 years.
        <br><br>
        The French Revolution merged the <b> Industrial Revolution </b>, which began in England around 1750, with the American Revolution in 1776 and the French Revolution in 1789. Similarly, the Industrial Revolution had far-reaching consequences. It not only changed the way goods were created, but it also changed the economic, social, and cultural backdrop of the time.
        <br><br>
        From the 1890s to the 1920s, the <b>Progressive Era</b> in the United States was marked by considerable social action and political reform. The Progressive movement's principal goals were to solve problems generated by industrialization, urbanization, immigration, and government corruption.
        <br><br><div id="contempo"></div>
        The <b>Machine Age </b>spans the early twentieth century, with the late nineteenth century thrown in for good measure. Around 1880 to 1945 would be a good estimate. It is a product of the Second Industrial Revolution's later stages.

                  <b>Postmodernity</b> is the state or condition of being postmodern following or reacting to modernity, as in postmodern art. Postmodernism is a late-twentieth-century art, architecture, and criticism style and concept that symbolizes a break from modernism and is characterized by a general rejection of large theories and ideologies, as well as a problematic relationship with any conception of "art."
                  <br><br>
                  During <b> World War I </b>, defensive technologies such as trenches, bunkers, and machine guns were significantly superior to offensive technologies such as artillery and troops rushing while protected by a thin covering of cotton uniform. Cavalry, the era's mobile technology, was rendered obsolete. Near the end of the war, the first replacement tanks were introduced. Air power did not play a significant part in the battle.
                  <br><br>
                  The <b>Atomic Age</b>, sometimes known as the Atomic Era, is the period of history following the detonation of the first nuclear bomb, Trinity, on July 16, 1945, during<b>World War II</b>, when new weapons, mostly tanks but also air power, made warfare much more mobile. As a result, World War II became much more about movement than construction and firepower concentration along a single thin defensive line. Tactics, information, and movement, not trenches and barbed wire, ruled the battlefield of the 1940s, as the Germans learnt first, and the Allies learned second.
                  <br><br>
                  The <b>Airplane</b> was created by <b>Orville and Wilbur Wright</b>. On this day in 1903, The Wright brothers successfully tested a flying contraption that took off on its own power on December 17, 1903, ushering in the era of human flight.
                  <br><br>
                  <b>John Philip Holland</b>, an Irish inventor, developed a model <b>submarine</b> in 1876 and a full-scale submarine in 1878, followed by a series of failed attempts. He designed the Holland Type VI submarine in 1896. On the surface, this vessel was powered by an internal combustion engine, while submerged operations were powered by an electric battery.

                  In 1914, a British army colonel named <b>Ernest Swinton and William Hankey</b>, secretary of the Committee for Imperial Defense, championed the idea of an armored vehicle with conveyor-belt-like tracks over its wheels that could break through enemy lines and traverse difficult terrain in response to trench warfare in World War I. The men approached Winston Churchill, the British navy minister, who believed in the concept of a "land boat" and formed the Landships Committee to start creating a prototype. Production employees were reportedly told that the trucks they were developing would be used to transport water on the battlefield to keep the project hidden from opponents.

                  Although serious development work on radar began in the 1930s, the underlying concept of <b>radar</b> dates to the late 1880s, when German physicist <b>Heinrich Hertz</b> conducted classical experiments on electromagnetic radiation.

                  In 1906, <b>Lewis Nixon</b> developed the first <b> Sonar </b> type listening apparatus to detect icebergs. When it became necessary to detect submarines during World War I, interest in sonar grew.

                  <b>Turing </b>created <b>'Turingery,'</b> a complicated <b>code-breaking</b> technique, in July 1942. Others at Bletchley used this method to figure out how to decipher the 'Lorenz' encryption machine.

                  On July 16, 1945, the <b>first atomic bomb</b> was successfully detonated near Alamogordo, New Mexico. The Trinity Test created an enormous mushroom cloud some 40,000 feet high. Oppenheimer is considered by many to be the "father of the atomic bomb".

                  The <b>Information Age</b>, also known as the <b>Computer Age, Digital Age, or New Media Age</b>, is a historical period in the twenty-first century marked by a rapid change from traditional industry to an economy centered on information technology, as a result of the Industrial Revolution's industrialization. This epoch marked the beginning of a period in which individuals had easy access to information and knowledge.
